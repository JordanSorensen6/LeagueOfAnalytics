# Abstract
League of Analytics is a website designed to help League of Legends players improve their winrate by providing players detailed information about their teammates, opponents champions, and by providing them a score for which they can get a general sence of their chances of winning before they get into the game. The score is generated based off applying scores to thousands of other games found online and determining the variables that tend to lead to a win. For example, teams that have players that choose champions that counter their opponent champion and have a high champion mastery rating will recieve a high score. Using our website in tandem with the champion select feature of League of Legends gives players a unique advantage allowing them to instantly get information about every player. No more frantic searching to get counter picks for a champion or to see an individual players stats. On top of this, players that score low have the option to dodge a game rather than taking a probable loss and losing more points then they would if they had just skipped the game instead. League of Analytics lets players see individual stats by looking at their previous games and what scores they got for those games. They are able to click on a game that they played in the past and see detailed information about every player they played with and against. League of Analytics provides players with application stats allowing them to see all the scores and the winrate that pertains to each score. With League of Analytics, League of Legends players are now able to win more and rage less.
