# Abstract
League of Analytics is a website designed to help League of Legends players improve their win rate by providing them with detailed information about their teammates, teammate's champions, and opponent's champions. We assign each game a score, which gives the player an idea of their chances of winning a given game before they even start playing. The score is calculated by applying scores to thousands of other games found online and determining the variables that tend to lead to a win. Using our website in tandem with the champion select feature of League of Legends gives players a unique advantage allowing them to instantly get information about every teammate and champion matchup. No more frantic searching to get counter picks for a champion or to see an individual player's stats. Along with detailed information about champion select, League of Analytics also provides players with previous game's stats and the application's stats on all the games we've analyzed. With League of Analytics, League of Legends players are now able to win more and rage less.
